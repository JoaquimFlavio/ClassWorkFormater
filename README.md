### Inspiration

Every week i need send my classworks to my teacher of university. But this step is so boryin!! 

I need folow this steps:

- Take picture with my smartphone
- send pictures to my PC
- Edit photos to get more visibility
- Sort the pictures in ascending
- Generate PDF

The 2 firsts steps not have easy solution.

And the others steps is fixed with this script!

### The other solutions

I've already tested some free apps to make the same workflow, and all works very good. But I'm really curious how far this project can fly. Using programing language to solve this problem, the sky is the limit ðŸš€
